Hi. My name’s Advait and I’m a student at Purdue University, graduating in 2024. I’m currently studying Data Science and Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Intelligence.

I love soccer, movies and music, and I’m trying to read more!

I’m interested in working as a data scientist/analyst, so I made this website to act as something between a blog and a data science portfolio. If you’d like to get in touch with me, please check out the contact page.
